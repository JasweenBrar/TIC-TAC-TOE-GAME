## üí† Explanation:

‚≠ê **print_board()** function as the name says just helps in printing the current tic-tac-toe board.

‚≠ê **player_move()** function is the most important function in this tic-tac-toe game. This function takes the position as input from the user and fills that position in the board with the symbol of that player.

‚≠ê **is_victory()** function just checks if any of the two players have won or not.

‚≠ê **is_draw()** function checks if the game is drawn or not.

‚≠ê And then comes our main while loop which keeps the game going.

‚≠ê This program will stop only when either one player has won or the game is drawn.
